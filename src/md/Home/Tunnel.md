# Ribosome Exit Tunnel

Ribosome exit tunnel, peptidyl-transferase center are of particular interest in the exploration of the translation process and evolutionary modifications in different species. We gather a selection of exit-tunnel replicas from the available structures in the hopes of further extending this dataset in the future.

The constitution of the exit tunnel is of interest for evolutionary, physio-chemical and pharmacological reasons. We provide a mechanism to export some preliminary data about the walls of the exit tunnel as well cylinder-centerline of the tunnel as is caputured in a given model.

Three main features are provided at the moment that characterize tunnel walls:

    1. Residue profile of the RPs that interface with the tunnel. (Each protein is identified by its new nomenclature (ex. uL4) where is possible and can thus be compared against homologous chains in other structures.The in-chain IDs of the tunnel-interfacing residues are provided for each protein.)

    2. Nucleotides of the RNA that interface with the tunnel.

    3. Ligands, ions or small molecules if any are found embedded in the walls of the tunnel.
