# Ribosomal Proteins

In order to enable comprehensive comparison of structures deposited by the community in to the RCSB/PDB, a common ontology is required for comparing proteins and the data associated with them across multiple files *(Fig. 1)*. One solution is to refer to Uniprot accession codes and/or InterPro families of the proteins, but the naming of ribosomal proteins presents a specific obstacle for data integration. Due to historical contingency, many ribosomal proteins from different species were originally assigned the same name, despite being often unrelated in structure and function. To eliminate confusion, a nomenclature has been proposed to standardize known ribosomal protein names and provide a framework for novel ones. While this nomenclature has been mostly adopted in recent structural studies, [ PFAM ](pfam.xfam.org/) families and UniProt database as well as PDB still contain numerous references to earlier naming systems.
