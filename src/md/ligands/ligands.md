### Ligands, Antibiotics, Ions and Small molecules

Ligands, antibiotics and small molecules that figure in the listed structures are gathered here. You can search acroos structures in which a given ligand is present or, conversely, see which ligands figure in given structure. 

Given that the binding interface of a certain ligand/antibiotic with the structures might be of interest, we export those in a separate(for now) <a href="/interfaces" >tool</a>.

We are also ignoring ions(most have not been parsed and listed) for the most part for now given their ubiquity in the resolved structures. We still acknolwedge their importance in certain cases  <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19279186/">( ex. the recurrent magnesium-binding motif near the PTC)</a> and aim to add those with more deliberation in later work.
