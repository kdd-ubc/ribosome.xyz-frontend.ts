### Current Limitations/Work in progress

 Due to the additional peculiarities of the mitochonodrial ribosome structrue, the current version of the database makes no distinction between cystosolic and mitochondiral, chloroplast ribosomes. Hence, the corresponding nomenclature classes(i.e. uL4*m* or uL4*c*) are also absent from the <a href="/rps">proteins repository</a>.  


 The species classes of certain structures are somewhat ambiguous due to the fact that PDB marks individual proteins, not whole structures as belongign to a certain species and hence if some structures contain proteins from multiple species, multiple species figure in this structure 's profile(<a href="/structs/3JA1">ex.</a>) 

    1. Classification of structures according to following charateristics is desirable, but is not yet implemneted:
        -  Stages of translation cycle
        -  Large/Small subunits introspection 
    2. Search according to a desirable set of proteins/ligands
    3. Classification for ribosomal proteins based on:
        - Buried/solvent-exposed/PTC-interfacing position
        - Neighboring proteins
    4. Nomenclature tool to deduce the class of a protein/proteins based on 3D structure/sequence
